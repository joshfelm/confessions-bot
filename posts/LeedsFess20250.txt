🙅🏼‍♀️Reason #152 not to get tinder🙅🏼‍♀️ Ladies, you will be disappointed with a pissed lad🤮who can’t get it up😒🙄begging to make him cum 5 times until 4am 😳😖 at the same time calling you “good… More girl” like some kind of dog?😤👿 then blabbering you’re ear off about how I met your mother.😑 (boys... this show is guy humour...calling a woman a kid in the bedroom is NOT SEXY🤮😳)....leaving you (not even high) but sore, dry, and extremely sleep deprived😭😭. No matter🤷🏼‍♀️ Ghost him only for him to wake you up multiple times w thirsty booty calls at 2am disturbing your beauty sleep 🤬 Then message you days later complaining how you “hurt his feelings” after he CLEARLY stated before you met up that he only wanted something “causal” 🥴🥴(am I not the only one where casual=sex w no feelings??) .....and they say females are emotional and confusing...🤦🏼‍♀️😵🙄
